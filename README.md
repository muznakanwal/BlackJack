# BlackJack
 
So this is my first shot at creating a JavaScript application and here's how it works.

Once launched, it will prompt for the player's name. Once added, the game will address them with their name.

BlackJack is a card game where the player can draw **three** cards in total, aiming to reach a cumulative **total score of 21**.
Each card can assume a value between 1 and 13.

Initially, **two cards** are dealt to the player with three possible outcomes:
1. The cumulative score is below 21. In this case, they can draw another card.
2. The cumulative score is exactly 21. In this case, the game ends and the player has won!
3. The cumulative score goes above 21. In this case, the game ends and the player has lost.

If after drawing the second card, the cumulative total is still less than 21, the game ends and the player has lost.

Clicking the Reset button will remove the existing values and deal new cards.

Give it a try! I know there's always room for improvement. Have fun!
